# Issue reporting guidelines

We want to address all issues in a timely manner and will inform the responsible teams of issues their products/services have. However we cannot guarantee that issues will be resolved.

Before creating an issue, please do the following:

- Check the [Developer Documentation](https://developer.riotgames.com/) to make sure the behavior you are reporting is really a bug, not a feature.
- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/issues) to make sure you are not duplicating somebody&#39;s work.
- Verify, that the issue you are about to report relates to the Riot Games Developer Ecosystem and is not a game bug.

If you are sure that the problem you are experiencing is caused by a bug, file a new issue in a Github issue tracker following the recommendations below.
